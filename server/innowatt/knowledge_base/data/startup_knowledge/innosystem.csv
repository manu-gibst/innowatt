Sidestep the prevalent pitfalls that often beset innovation initiatives.
...then embracing a structured and methodical approach to innovation management is your next strategic move. This approach not only equips you with the tools and knowledge to navigate the complexities of innovation but also empowers you to make it a sustainable and thriving facet of your business."
INNOVATION? What is that?,"INNOVATION - involves the effective utilization of a novel concept to create value. This can apply to a product, service, process, model, or a blend thereof. While some ideas may be modest in scope, others can be more expansive; however, all innovative ideas share a common trait of being original and have the potential to make a significant impact.

Innovation management is a disciplined approach that merges the freedom and creativity necessary for generating ideas with the structured processes needed to transform those ideas into tangible innovations. It encompasses defining, planning, and executing the necessary steps, while managing risks, investments, and project timelines. This field effectively balances the spontaneity of idea creation with the rigor and formality required for successful implementation.

An Innovation Management System (IMS) consists of a coordinated network of elements and processes that empower an organization to boost and refine its innovation potential. This system includes a comprehensive grasp of the organizational context geared towards innovation and value creation. It integrates structured and systematic planning, leadership engagement, and the support and execution of innovation activities. Additionally, it involves ongoing monitoring and evaluation to fuel consistent enhancement and progress.


"
WHY YOU NEED IT?,"To consistently generate ideas that bolster the viability and sustainability of a business, it's crucial to intentionally implement a system designed to:

Align innovation efforts with the broader business strategy, ensuring that these endeavors complement and enhance the company’s overarching goals;
Equip employees with the necessary programs, tools, and techniques to foster creativity, enabling them to address challenges effectively and convert their insights and ideas into quantifiable business value;
Encourage behaviors and undertake activities that are likely to attract new customers or facilitate entry into new markets; and
Facilitate engagement with emerging technologies and forge partnerships that could offer a competitive edge or contribute to the development of valuable intellectual property (IP)."
Innovation Appetite ,"Many organizations hesitate to embrace innovation, viewing it as 'disruptive' or 'radical,' often associated with the notion of creating something entirely new. This apprehension might stem from the misconception that innovation is exclusive to entities with research and development departments, or it might seem irrelevant to non-profit or charitable organizations not focused on developing new products or generating profits. However, innovation encompasses a broad spectrum of activities that can significantly benefit any organization across all sectors. The ISO 56000:2020 standard, which covers Innovation management – Fundamentals and vocabulary, delineates various levels of innovation, making it clear that innovation is not a one-size-fits-all concept:

Incremental innovation focuses on enhancing existing processes, products, or services.
Radical or breakthrough innovation introduces a high degree of change, either in the product or service itself or in its broader impact.
Disruptive innovation targets initially less demanding markets with new offerings that eventually displace established competitors.
Each type of innovation presents its own set of risks and opportunities. Organizations are encouraged to evaluate their own risk tolerance and the potential rewards of each innovation type to craft a strategy that aligns with their unique goals and capabilities."
Easy start ,"Initiating innovation management within your organization is a straightforward process that can be accomplished through several clear steps:

Recognize and define the necessity and specific context for innovation within your organization to ensure relevance and direction.
Appoint a dedicated individual to spearhead innovation efforts, ensuring this person has robust backing from the leadership team to foster an environment conducive to innovative thinking.
Craft a clear vision that outlines your aspirations and what you aim to achieve through your innovation efforts, providing a guiding light for all activities.
