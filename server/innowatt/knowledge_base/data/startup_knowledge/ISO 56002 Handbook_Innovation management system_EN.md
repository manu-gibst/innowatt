## Foreword

Compare your life now to how it was a decade ago. In the past, almost all aspects
of life involved more effort, whether it was getting a taxi, renting your favorite
movie, or ordering a meal. Today, we can do most of these activities while sitting
in a comfortable armchair with nothing more than a small touchscreen phone. All
these products, processes, and services have come about because creative people or
companies saw an opportunity in the marketplace and came up with an innovative
solution. It may seem that some of these innovations came about by a fluke, but in
most cases, they are the result of a carefully managed process. The ISO 56002:2019,
_Innovation management system – Guidance_ ̧ developed by ISO/TC 2 79, _Innovation
management_ , aims to provide organizations with the support they need to develop
a systematic approach to effective and efficient innovation. In other words, it is a
tool to help your organization spotlight great ideas and initiatives that are directly
linked to your vision. This handbook focuses on the fundamental principles of
innovation management, which include strategic direction, organizational culture,
insights, and adaptability.
Organizations of all sizes and sectors can benefit by following the guidelines and
ensuring that they are able to adapt and evolve with their environment. To further
support organizations on their innovation management journey, this handbook
has been published with the aim of extending the guidelines from ISO 56002:2019.

The content of the handbook is structured to help users understand the processes to
successfully innovate and deliver value to stakeholders. Similar to the application
of standard ISO 56002:2019, any type of organization can use this handbook. It is
of particular interest to SMEs looking to develop or improve a structured approach
to innovation.
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the United Nations
Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) have jointly published this hand-
book with the immense support of ISO/TC 279. UNIDO initiated the drafting of the
handbook simultaneously with the development of the ISO 56002:2019 standard for
dissemination in developing countries as a capacity development tool for standard
bodies, innovation institutions, and academia. For its finalization and validation, a
dedicated task force was established within the ISO/TC 279. The handbook provides
practical tools and methods to countries for more and better innovations towards
inclusive and sustainable development.
We hope your Organization can benefit from this publication and become more
resilient, innovative, and prepared for an ever-evolving world.

### Introduction to innovation management

Innovation is widely recognized as being a key factor in driving economic growth,
development of society and increased well-being. Despite good intentions and
successful pilots, organizations often struggle to make innovation an enduring
and sustainable part of their business.
If you have...

- generated ideas through creativity sessions, design thinking, or online inven-
    tiveness and want to take them to the next level;
- struggled to commercialize ideas that your team has generated;
- recently taken up responsibility for innovation, and wondered where to start;
- identified a need to fundamentally transform your organization; or
- a drive to simply do things differently.

... and you want to...

- be confident that you’re solving the right problems;
- generate solutions that will disrupt your market;
- build confidence in your ability to manage innovation; or
- avoid some of the common innovation pitfalls.

... then you should consider taking a formalized and systemic approach to
delivering innovation.

```
Innovation
```
```
is the successful
```
```
exploitation of a new idea to realize value. It can relate to a product, a service, a process, a model or any combination of these. Some ideas
```
```
are small, some are big; but
innovative ideas will be novel and
```
```
will make a difference.
```
```
Innovation management
```
```
is
```
```
about dening, planning and executing the steps required to
progress ideas into innovations. It is a discipline that combines the
```
```
freedom and creativity of generating ideas with the formality required to manage risks, investments and project
```
```
implementation.
```
```
An
```
```
innovation management
system (IMS)
```
```
is a set of interrelat-
```
```
ed and interacting elements and activities that enable an organiza-tion to develop and enhance its innovation capabilities. These elements and activities include an understanding of the organizational context, leadership commitment towards innovation and realization of value, formal and systemic planning, support and operation of innovation activities, and sustained monitoring and measurements to drive continuous improvement.

This overview of the ISO 56002:2019, _Innovation management — Innovation
management system — Guidance_ , provides a short introduction to what good
looks like when it comes to managing innovation according to experts from over
50 countries.
Consistently generating ideas that will ensure the viability and sustainability
of a business requires a conscious decision to put a system in place which will:

- ensure the effort spent on innovation is aligned to, and supports your overall
    business strategy;
- provide talent-related requirements such as programmes, tools and techniques
    that enable all your employees to derive creative solutions to the challenges
    they face, and to transform those insights and ideas into tangible business
    value that can be measured;
- drive behaviours and activities that can result in attracting new customers or
    expanding into new markets; and
- support exposure to novel technologies and partnerships which could give a
    competitive advantage or build intellectual property (IP).

It’s likely that your competitors will be embedding innovation in all that they do,
quickly responding to changes in markets and operating conditions, and achieving
sustained and repeatable innovation success. Ad hoc innovation does add value
in the short term, but without systematic support, it will tend to be sporadic and
non-sustainable.
You can secure sustained innovation capabilities by implementing a systematic
approach. An innovation management system helps you promote, facilitate and
manage innovation to realize your organization’s full innovation potential.

### Innovation management principles

The foundation and successful management of an innovation
system depends on a number of key principles.

▸ **Principle 1:** Realization of value
The purpose of innovation is to realize value, whether financial or
non-financial, through identifying, understanding, and satisfying
the needs and expectations of interested parties.

▸ **Principle 2:** Future-focused leaders
Leaders across the organization need to inspire and engage all
teams to challenge the status-quo and balance short-term perfor-
mance with resourcing future success.

▸ **Principle 3:** Strategic direction
The innovation vision, innovation strategy and associated innova-
tion objectives must be defined and aligned with the overall
strategic direction of the organization.

▸ **Principle 4:** Culture
A focus on operational excellence and efficiency needs to be
broadened to develop values, beliefs and behaviours that support
the creation and implementation of new ideas.

▸ **Principle 5:** Exploiting insights
Identify needs and opportunities, and then apply a systematic
approach to gain diverse insights that can be exploited to generate
new ideas to realize value. Go beyond the obvious and incorporate
a glimpse of the future.

▸ **Principle 6:** Managing uncertainty
Balance the exploitation of ideas with the management of risks.
Taking a portfolio approach allows experimentation and exploita-
tion, building confidence during times of uncertainty.

```

▸ **Principle 7:** Adaptability
Exploiting new ideas often requires changes to structures, processes, skills and
delivery models. Embrace these changes and provide support to those implement-
ing them.

▸ **Principle 8:** Systems approach
Work together towards a common innovation purpose by understanding all the
components. Managing innovation as a system improves learning, effectiveness
and impact.

##### INNOVATION APPETITE

```
Many organizations are put off of innovation because it is perceived to be
‘disruptive’ or ‘radical’ and focused on inventing something new. Perhaps you
believe it doesn’t apply to you because you don’t have an R&D department; or
perhaps you work in a not-for-profit or charity and are not focused on generating
new products (or even on generating profits).
Innovations with high a degree of novelty grab the headlines, but there are levels of
innovation that can impact any organization and that are relevant across all sectors.
ISO 56000:2020, Innovation management – Fundamentals and vocabulary defines
those different levels as follows :
▸ Incremental innovation is about improving what you do today.
▸ Radical or breakthrough innovation is an innovation with high degree of change
where the change can relate to the product or service itself or to its impact.
▸ Disruptive innovation is an innovation that initially addresses less demanding
needs, displacing established offerings.
Each type of innovation carries different risks, and each organization should assess
their own appetite for the risks and benefits of each approach as part of defining
their innovation strategy.

policy, strategy, objectives and processes that are needed to fulfil its innovation
aspirations.
The innovation management system coordinates and directs the organization’s
innovation activities to ensure alignment to their customer and business
requirements. It also provides mechanisms to measure and improve innovation
effectiveness and efficiency on a continuous basis.

### Getting started

Getting started with innovation management isn’t difficult, and can be achieved
in a few simple steps:

**1.** Establish the need and context for innovation in your organization.
**2.** Identify one person to own and drive innovation who has the full support of
    the leadership team.
**3.** Set a vision for what you want to achieve through innovation.
**4.** Define an internal roadmap for innovation that’s aligned to your corporate
    strategy and includes a set of objectives and measures.
**5.** Assign resources and give the people working in your organization the
    support, training and time they need to deliver innovation.
**6.** Identify innovation opportunities and challenges to focus on the creation
    of novel ideas. Verify those ideas with your users or customers, and develop
    them into new services, products or operations.

The introduction of an innovation management system will help to create a cul-
ture of innovation, which in turn will make your innovation activities ‘sticky’
and sustainable.

This overview relates to the ISO 56000 family of standards, developed by the
International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and most specifically to
ISO 56002:2019.
If this overview has been of interest, there is a key reference that you might find
useful:
▸ ISO 56002, Innovation management — Innovation management system
— Guidance
This standard provides comprehensive guidance for those looking to establish,
implement, maintain and continually improve an innovation management
system. Importantly, it doesn’t mandate how you should innovate, but instead
outlines aspects to be considered if you are planning to innovate. It is available at
the ISO Online Browsing Platform: https://www.iso.org/obp.

## Introduction

### Purpose of this handbook

Innovation may appear to be a uniquely creative process, seemingly without struc-
ture. However, innovation rarely happens by chance, and it is more likely to result
from an organized process that is sometimes not obvious, but nonetheless real.
Accepting that innovation is the result of a process means that it is possible to
organize activities in such a way that innovation is more likely to happen and
will be more effective.
This handbook provides guidance for organizations wanting to innovate, and it
expands upon the standard ISO 56002:2019, _Innovation management — Innovation
management system — Guidance_. This handbook increases the understanding of
and outlines a progressive implementation approach to the many recommenda-
tions of ISO 56002:2019. It is particularly focused on small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) where it can be used to initiate or improve innovation dynamics.
The handbook is structured as a series of questions, followed by operational
guidelines and explanations that are aligned with ISO 56002:2019. In some cases,
it provides additional knowledge and tools that facilitate the launch of an innova-
tion and the transition to become an innovative organization.
This handbook is the result of a collaboration between ISO and UNIDO, written
by a panel of innovation and standardization experts.

### Standardization background

Standardization is a tool for improving the relevance and competitiveness of any
given organization. Standards are created at national, regional (such as Euro-
pean), and international levels. International Standards are published by the
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) which is an independent,
non-governmental international organization with a membership of 165 national
standards bodies, **https://www.iso.org/about-us.html**.
Through its members, ISO brings together experts to share knowledge and develop
voluntary, consensus-based, market-relevant International Standards that sup-
port innovation and competitiveness, and provide solutions to global challenges.
In addition to other categories of standards, ISO has developed management sys-
tem standards (MSS). A management system is the way in which an organization
manages the interrelated parts of its business in order to achieve its objectives.
Such objectives can relate to several different topics, including product or service
quality, operational efficiency, social responsibility, environmental performance,
health and safety in the workplace, and many more.
All ISO MSS are based upon a common harmonized structure that enables inte-
gration across management systems. Thus, an organization can implement sev-
eral MSS and benefit from the additionality provided by an efficient approach to
implementing different systems.
A MSS can be “Type A MSS” or Type B MSS”. Type A contains requirements against
which an organization can demonstrate alignment, whereas a Type B contains
guidance that does not lead to certification.
After many national and multinational initiatives (see Annex A), in 2013, ISO set
up a technical committee ISO/TC 2 79, _Innovation management_ , to draft stand-
ards in the domain of innovation management. In 2019, ISO/TC 279 published a
Type B MSS: ISO 56002:2019, _Innovation management — Innovation management
system – Guidance_. The associated definitions of this guidance are published in
ISO 56000:2020, _Innovation management — Fundamentals and vocabulary_ , and
are the founding elements of this handbook.

### Understanding the system approach

ISO 56000:2020, _Innovation management — Fundamentals and vocabulary_ , defines
innovation as “a new or changed entity, realizing or redistributing value” where:

- Entity can refer to a product, service, process, model or method;
- Value can be financial or non-financial (e.g. image, strategic advantage, knowl-
    edge acquisition, IP); and
- Novelty (newness) and value are relative to, and determined by, the perception
    of the organization and interested parties.

Innovation is defined as an outcome rather than an activity, and innovation man-
agement is the method of defining, planning and executing the steps required
to innovate.
Delivering successful innovation is an important challenge and often consumes
considerable resources. However, it is becoming critical to innovate regularly, and
this leads enterprises to look for an efficient way to manage innovation activities,
and to integrate innovation activities into daily business life.
Managing innovation activities efficiently means being able to mobilize the ade-
quate processes, resources, and skills at the right time. These interrelated and
interacting elements and activities, when combined, form what ISO 56002:
defines as an innovation management system.
By developing an innovation management system that meets the needs of your
organization, you will increase your ability to deliver new products, processes or
services and business models. Formalizing the management system provides a
solid basis for innovation and allows for continuous improvement. As with any
management system, the innovation management system can be continuously
improved by using and Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) approach.

### Structure of the handbook

Enterprises often start their innovation journey by seizing an opportunity, experi-
menting with the generation of ideas, and developing an innovation. For this
reason, this handbook does not follow the exact sequence of ISO 56002:2019,
which describes the various components of an innovation management system.
Instead, this handbook addresses the process required to successfully deliver
an innovation. The later sections then invite you to take a step back and look at
all the other elements that should be considered when deploying an innovation
management system to reinforce your enterprise’s abilities to innovate.
The guidance presented in this handbook does not necessarily need to be imple-
mented all at the same time, or even in the sequence shown. Taking a systems
approach will ensure that all the elements are tied together and that your organi-
zation considers all the aspects and elements required to innovate successfully.

## Delivering innovations

_Do you consider that your organization has established adaptable processes
for innovation initiatives?_

The first concern of managers, when they start to get interested in the concept
of an innovation management system, is to bring an innovation to the market
in a structured way. This is why the first chapter of the handbook is devoted to
delivering innovation. However, we strongly recommend that you read all the
chapters as you aim to develop effective innovation capabilities (see **Figure 1** ).

### Innovation initiatives

In terms of operational planning and control, ISO 56002:2019 suggests that every
innovation activity needs to be managed, whether it leads to an incremental
change or a more radical, disruptive change.
ISO 56002:2019 provides a comprehensive list of aspects and perspectives that
each organization needs to consider, some of which are highlighted below.

```
SCOPE
Set a clear scope for the innovation activities − what is to be included and excluded;
what are the objectives, constraints, expected outputs and deliverables?
INDICATORS
Define and agree on a set of measures to inform decision-making along the innovation
processes and drive continuous improvement. Determine how these measures will be
evaluated.
LEADERSHIP
Provide strong leadership to empower, encourage and support the team, ensuring
they have the resources they need.
TEAM
Make sure the right people are involved and that they are available to review and
make key decisions. Create a broader team when needed, and include suppliers, third
parties, educational bodies, customers, and other interested parties when their input
could add value.
DECISIONS
Agree how decisions are to be made and who will lead the process. There will be
a lot of unknowns and uncertainties, so agreeing on the next steps will be critical
throughout the innovation activities.

```

##### ROLES

```
Define all the key roles and ensure those taking on the roles are committed and
understand their critical importance to the organization.
EARLY ASSET CAPTURE
Watch out for any opportunities to protect the IP you are building. It can be all too easy
to give this away and fail to leverage the value it generates.
REVIEWING & LEARNING
Review and capture feedback to refine the process as it becomes integrated into the
organization’s other processes and systems.
```
When implementing your innovation activities, aim to manage the process con-
sistently, whether you have one internal process or many and whether you plan
one or several innovation activities.
When agreeing on the approach to managing innovation initiatives, seek input
from many people across all disciplines within the organization. Lead this with
positive determination and energy. Consider building a network online to make it
easier to listen to and learn from others who have successfully innovated within
their own organizations.
As you learn how others deliver successful innovation, carry out a further review
of your own innovation model to refine it further.

### Innovation processes

Well-structured innovation processes provide a framework to guide the organi-
zation through the steps required to address a need to change or to improve.
Your organization needs to determine processes that work for you, and that are
appropriate to the scope, constraints and ambitions of your innovation initiatives.
The innovation processes guide those involved, step by step, on how to undertake
the innovation activities.

Management System._

Clear processes for innovation within your organization will enable you to author-
ize, empower and train your people to explore better ways of delivering positive
outcomes. Organizational thinking is often bound within a set of organizational
constraints, and the innovation processes grant permission to take a more open
approach to exploring the root causes of any challenges, and to seeking out new
and smarter solutions.

The previous diagram ( **Figure 2** ) shows how innovation processes are represented
in ISO 56002:2019. Unlike more traditional processes and operating procedures,
innovation processes are not linear, and it does require a more open mindset than
is required for more traditional work practices.
Well-considered and effective innovation processes will provide guidance on:
▸ identifying the right opportunities and problems to address, for the benefit of
your organization and the other interested parties;
▸ creating concepts that will address the challenge in the right way for
all involved, whether this results in a small incremental change or in a
disruptive or radical change;
▸ validating the concept, whether it is a new or updated service, product,
technology platform or business model (or indeed a combination of all four)
to ensure it meets the issue or challenge being addressed;
▸ developing the concept into a viable solution that can be exploited to have a
positive impact, and realize value; and
▸ deploying the solution to its relevant market, once there is confidence that the right
solution has been developed, and a commercialization plan has been agreed.

### Identify opportunities

```
IDENTIFY
OPPORTUNITIES
```
The first stage of the process is to identify and capture oppor-
tunities for innovation within the organization’s context.
This stage focuses on identifying areas of the organization,
or its service or product offerings, that may lead to innova-
tion and the generation, validation, development and ulti-
mately deployment of new solutions.

Objectives of this stage

Novel ideas can originate from many places but many may be less relevant to
a specific organization. To focus innovation effort, it is critical to set the scope
and boundaries for the generation of new ideas. The scope for innovation will be
influenced by gaining insights from market trends, research, horizon scanning
and from a review of internal processes, products and services.
The opportunities must be aligned to organizational needs and aspirations
and should take into account the learning and experiences from previous busi-
ness activities.

Inputs into this stage

- The organizational context and intent for innovation has been agreed;
- a clear scope of the innovation initiative outlines how radical or otherwise
    ideas and new concepts should be;
- requirements (or constraints) as related to the innovation agenda within the
    organization; and
- insights and knowledge gained from external sources, such as emerging
    technologies, industry trends, or changes to the markets the organization
    operates within.

```

Challenges you might face during this stage

- A reluctance to change the existing portfolio of products and services;
- a lack of awareness of technology or market trends that could apply to the
    organization; and
- a narrow perspective on challenges the organization faces, often leading to
    cost-cutting exercises rather than investment in new innovation.

Outputs from this stage

- A clearly identified opportunity or prioritized opportunities that can be used
    as the basis for idea generation;
- clear guidance for ideating against the opportunity, considering the scope,
    potential constraints, and acceptance criteria for the ideas generated in the
    next stage;
- an understanding of the state-of-the-art, including a consideration of intel-
    lectual property rights (IPR) as applicable; and
- an understanding of the potential value to be realized and other potential
    impacts (positive or negative)”.

### Create concepts

```
CREATE
CONCEPTS
```
Having identified opportunities, the next step is to develop
concepts or ideas which have the potential to be trans-
formed into future products, services or business processes.
New ideas can come from a range of sources that are inter-
nal or external to the organization, and the actual idea
generation can be performed using a variety of techniques such as creativity
workshops, online ideation, design thinking, or experimentation.
The methods or process an organization uses should take into account the skills
and the capabilities of those involved; the needs of interested parties; alignment
with innovation strategy; and the time and resources available.

Objectives of this stage

These usually include developing new ideas or potential solutions from internal
and external sources; using a variety of ideation and creative problem-solving
techniques; and identifying ideas that could have the potential to be developed
into a viable product or service. The ideation activities can result in the generation
of hundreds of ideas, which need to be further validated against criteria such as
feasibility, desirability, affordability, risk, novelty or sustainability.

Inputs into this stage

- A clearly defined opportunity, or prioritized opportunities;
- ideation skills, with those facilitating ideation being competent in a variety
    of innovation techniques such as design thinking, ideation, and creative
    problem-solving; and
- clearly defined evaluation criteria to allow the assessment and selection
    of ideas.

```

Challenges you might face during this stage

- Lack of ideation skills because of inadequate training for those driving
    the ideation;
- insufficient resources or time commitment to innovation and idea generation;
- key influencers prejudging and dismissing ideas before they have been fully
    validated; and
- not understanding the appetite that the organization has towards taking a
    risk when it comes to innovation.

Outputs from this stage

- A list of all generated ideas assessed against the agreed selection criteria;
- a shortlist of concepts to be taken through to validation, and their associated
    preliminary value realization model; and
- an initial assessment of the risks, degree of novelty, and critical uncertainties
    associated with each shortlisted idea.

### Validate concepts

```
VALIDATE
CONCEPTS
```
```
Once novel ideas have been generated and shortlisted, this
critical but often overlooked step is required to ensure con-
cepts have been well thought through before embarking on
expensive and time-consuming solution development.
```
Objectives of this stage

Verifying the feasibility of the concept aims to reduce uncertainty and confirm
commercial viability. By focusing effort on validated concepts, resources can be
engaged most efficiently on the initiatives most likely to add value. Validation
should start before any significant time or money is spent on solution develop-
ment. You may want to consider one or more approaches to validation, such as
user testing, experimentation, prototyping and pilots, and research studies.
When validating concepts, it is critical to reduce uncertainties and challenge
assumptions and get feedback as soon as possible. This knowledge and feedback
can come from customers, users, partners (internal or external to the organization)
or from other interested parties.
Validation can take many forms − prototyping, experimentation, studies, customer
discovery interviews, etc. Regardless of how validation is achieved, the key factor
is that the feedback and new knowledge gained are used to refine and improve
the concept.

Inputs into this stage

- A shortlisted idea from the creation stage;
- clear acceptance criteria set out for the validation process (you need to know
    what ‘good’ looks like to your organization); and
- a clearly defined approach to concept validation that is appropriate to the
    organization and the concept, e.g. it might not be sensible or appropriate to
    create a technical prototype for a new service offering.

```

Challenges you might face during this stage

- A vague or unclear concept;
- lack of skills to create a viable prototype for a new product;
- insufficient time or budget to conduct the validation step;
- a fixed, pre-existing view on how the concept will be received by the mar-
    ket; and
- an unwillingness to hear potentially negative feedback from customers
    or partners.

Outputs from this stage

- A refined, validated concept ready to be developed;
- reduced uncertainty associated with the concept;
- insights and knowledge that are new to the organization; and
- an improved level of trust and cooperation with customers, partners and other
    interested parties outside of the organization.

### Develop solutions

```
DEVELOP
SOLUTIONS
```
```
Once concepts have been validated, the next target is to
develop practical solutions, ready for deployment.
```
Objectives of this stage

These usually relate to transitioning from a broad view of the opportunity and
the various ideas created to developing a specific solution. Not every idea will
be taken through to this development stage, or on to deployment, so during this
stage the various elements of a viable solution are created which can realize value
for the key interested parties. Once the various elements of the overall solution
are proven, then these can be brought together and refined into a solution that
can be deployed.

Inputs into this stage

- Concepts that have been identified, elaborated upon and validated;
- a broad understanding of the risks, uncertainties and benefits associated
    with the solution;
- lessons learned from the validation stage, such as results of experimentation,
    outputs of user testing, or market analysis; and
- an outline, or detailed, business case as required by the organization to justify
    the investment in the development phase.

Challenges you might face during this stage

- Unrealistic expectations regarding costs or timelines to develop the solution;
- Failure to consider IP (generated or potentially using others);

```

- not considering the full impact on the organization in terms of budgets or
    structural changes required to support the solution;
- legal, environmental, regulatory or political considerations; and
- lack of specialist skills required to develop the solution.

Outputs from this stage

- A viable solution that is ready for deployment including a plan with established
    activities, resources, relationship and timing to fulfil all the deployment needs
    and requirements;
- a go/no-go decision to move to deployment − some solutions may be identified
    as non-viable and therefore terminated during the development stage, some
    others may be identified as needing further analysis before deployment and
    may go back to previous innovation processes. Finally, the organization may
    choose to hold on to a solution for a while, waiting for the context to align with
    the desired impact of this solution; and
- a model outlining how the solution might impact the organization and the
    chosen target market.

### Deploy solutions

```
DEPLOY
SOLUTIONS
```
```
Once solutions have been developed to the point of being ready
to be implemented, the organization should consider the
approach to deployment that will best support successful and
widespread adoption.
```
Objectives of this stage

A common objective is to introduce the product or service generally, in a manner
that ensures the introduction is timely and to an agreed level of quality. This allows
the organization to realize the potential value, perhaps in terms of increased
revenue, improved relationships, larger market share, or a positive impact on
users and interested parties. Large scale deployment often represents a degree
of product or service maturity.

Inputs into this stage

- A solution that has been developed in accordance with organizational standards;
- a clear value-proposition and marketing/sales plan to ensure the solution is
    available and promoted, so that the impact is maximized; and
- a defined mechanism for monitoring the success of the deployment, in terms
    of uptake, sales, savings or other form of impact.

Challenges you might face during this stage

- A solution not ready for full deployment, which might not be fully viable
    and requires further refinement or further development to reach the status
    of deployment-ready;
- changed market needs after the concept was validated, especially if planning
    and monitoring of the market is not done during the development stage; and
- risks escalate to issues if not managed carefully.

Outputs from this stage

- Realized value and a positive impact on the organization and its interested
    parties, e.g. an increase in turnover, profit, market share and social impact; and
- additional insights gained throughout all stages of the innovation processes,
    which should be captured and fed back into the innovation system to perhaps
    identify opportunities for further innovations or continuously improve your
    innovation management system.

## Designing the innovation management system

To develop your organization’s capabilities to innovate, setting up a development
process for innovation is an important element, but it is not the only one. This
process is just one part of an innovation management system that will enable
your organization to innovate more effectively.
The following chapter will assist you in the design of your innovation manage-
ment system (see **Figure 4** ).

### Understanding the organization and its context

_Do you consider that your organization carries out internal and external analy-
sis as well as it is able to in order to identify trends and future developments?_

Organizations are immersed in a context where external and internal issues inter-
act with their processes, affecting the way they operate and their results. Therefore,
any planning should include an analysis of the context since it can affect, either
positively or negatively, the organization’s ability to achieve the intended results of
its innovation management system. Furthermore, in accordance with the innova-
tion management principle ‘exploiting insights’, understanding the context of an
organization and its external and internal issues is crucial in creating knowledge
that will be used to generate innovative ideas, as it allows identification of areas
of opportunity for value realization.
Consequently, the organization should use appropriate methods to determine the
internal and external issues and provide useful information to manage innovation.
As those issues can change over time, they should be monitored and reviewed
at an appropriate frequency.
Examples of external issues relevant to the organization’s context can include
(but are not limited to): 

- economic factors such as macro-economic situation, inflation forecast, credit
    availability, funding sources, and tax reduction opportunities;
- social factors such as trends related to environmental and sustainability issues,
    education levels, demographic issues and diversity, work and lifestyle;
- political factors such as regulations, legislation, political stability, public poli-
    cies on innovation, and international trade agreements;
- technological factors such as new technology, new materials and equipment,
    patent expirations, professional codes of ethics, standards, and scientific
    developments; and

```
ISO Store Order: OP-730034 license #1/ Downloaded: 2023-11-15
Single user licence only, copying and networking prohibited.
```

- market factors such as user needs and expectations (unmet or uncovered),
    market leader trends, supply chain and partner relationships, national innova-
    tion infrastructure, potential opportunities and threats, e.g. those that might
    result from disruptions.

This scanning can be done at local, regional and international level.
Examples of internal issues can be related to:

- strategic direction, vision, overall performance of the organization and present
    innovation practices and activities, ambition level, and other MSS implemented
    in the organization;
- human aspects such as core competences, creativity and knowledge manage-
    ment, organizational behaviours and culture supporting innovation activities,
    relationships among different hierarchy levels and areas of the organization,
    and commitment at all levels of the organization;
- operational factors such as business models, processes, products and
    services, existing supporting innovation tools and methods, budgeting
    and collaboration;
- governance factors, such as rules and procedures for decision-making,
    organizational structure, tolerance to failure, risk appetite, and resistance
    to change; and
- potential and maturity (position on the life cycle) of current offerings and
    value realization models.

Information about external issues can be found in many sources, such as internal
documented information and from meetings; in the national and international
press; Websites; publications from national statistics offices and other government
departments; professional and technical publications; conferences and meetings
with relevant agencies; meetings with customers and interested parties, and;
professional associations.
Once relevant information sources have been identified, it is important to consult
them regularly to identify and analyse possible opportunities and threats related
to your current strategic direction and innovation portfolio.

```

When a major issue has been identified, a brief analysis should be presented to
top management to ease decision-making.
At the strategic level, tools such as the Political, Economic, Social, Technological,
Legal, Environmental (PESTLE) analysis, followed by a Strengths, Weaknesses,
Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis, can be used to gather information.
Simpler approaches, such as brainstorming and asking “what if” questions,
can also be useful, depending on the size and complexity of an organiza-
tion’s operations.
One common approach is to first to carry out a PESTLE analysis, then process
the information gathered through the 2x2 matrix shown below (see **Figure 5** ).

```

The matrix is very useful for ‘separating the wheat from the chaff’. You may find
that some issues landing on the grey boxes could be disregarded if you are look-
ing for a quick and focused exercise or to go through a second round of analysis.
After the PESTLE and the matrix have been done, the contextual analysis may be
completed by a SWOT analysis using only the issues falling into the green box.
The “strengths” and “opportunities” detected will then become opportunities for
the innovation management system, and the “weaknesses” and “threats” will
be treated as risks to the innovation management system. We will come back to
this later.
It is important to understand that this is not a “one-shot exercise”; the organization
should monitor and review information about the external and internal issues
regularly. This task could be performed during management review meetings or
during a specific meeting to address this task.

### and expectations Determining the relevant interested parties, their needs

### their needs and expectations

_Do you consider that all relevant interested parties’ needs and expectations
have been determined? Have you defined how to interact with all of them?_

Understanding present and future needs and expectations of relevant interested
parties would bring in opportunities with the potential for the realization of value.
Therefore, it is important to identify them as part of the process for understanding
the context of the organization.
Interested parties and their requirements, needs and expectations could be dif-
ferent for the different initiatives and projects of your innovation portfolio, and
can change due to unforeseen circumstances. The following is a non-exhaustive
list of some examples of interested parties that can be considered relevant to
an organization:

- customers, end users or beneficiaries;
- joint venture partners, suppliers;
- owners of IP;
- parent and subsidiary organizations;
- employees, owners, shareholders;
- financial institutions, cooperation agencies, international development banks;
- research organizations, science communities, universities;
- statutory and regulatory authorities (local, regional, national or interna-
    tional); and
- scientific and professional associations.

```

Determining which interested parties are relevant for your innovation manage-
ment system requires criteria, such as:

- possible influence or impact on the organization’s performance or decisions;
- ability to create opportunities and manage risks;
- possible influences or impact on the market or society; and
- ability to affect the organization through their decisions or activities.

Once again, after listing all the parties considered of interest by, or interested
in, your organization, you could compare each of them against a 2x2 matrix
such as the one showed below in **Figure 6**. This is a simple and quick method
to determine the relevance of an interested party. The matrix can be used
as follows:

The organization should regularly monitor and review the relevant interested
parties of its innovation management system as well as their needs and expecta-
tions and any particular requirements to detect whether any change will have a
significant impact on the innovation management system, or on areas of oppor-
tunity for value realization.

### Setting the scope of the innovation management system

_Are you satisfied with the established scope of the innovation management
system in your organization and its associated documentation?_

An innovation management system is a set of processes, activities and resources
that work together to generate innovation. Therefore, when the organization
decides to implement an innovation management system it has to identify not
only the processes related with the innovation activities themselves (those needed
to realize value from insights and ideas), but also the processes that are needed
for the effective implementation, maintenance and improvement of the system.
Such processes can include internal audits, management reviews, planning,
and improvement, as well as processes performed by partners or other external
interested parties. The level to which processes need to be determined and detailed
can vary according to the context of the organization and the application of risk-
based thinking. The extent to which the processes affect the organization’s ability
to achieve its intended results (innovations) should be considered.
In some organizations, including SMEs, innovation processes are probably not
explicitly defined and there might be a lack of a common understanding of the
processes among the different participants engaged in innovation activities.
Managing innovation with a systemic approach would allow the organization to
get a clear and common understanding of which processes are part of the innova-
tion management system, and be able to integrate the innovation management
system within other existing management systems. This would facilitate the
assessment, benchmarking and improvement of the innovation management
system and help focus on the most important and relevant innovation activities
and enablers.
The scope of your innovation management system should be decided on the basis
of the result of an analysis carried out by the organization’s top management. The
innovation management system can include the whole organization, specifically

identified functions of the organization, specifically identified sections of the
organization, or one or more functions across a group of organizations. At a mini-
mum, the following should be considered when establishing the scope:

- the understanding of the context;
- the needs and expectations of the relevant interested parties;
- the opportunities to realize value; and
- the organizational structure, the existing competences and capabilities and
    the interactions with other management systems.

Documenting the scope of the innovation management system will help to ensure
that your own organization and the relevant interested parties understand it.
The organization should consider that the scope is dynamic and needs timely
updating. Assessing the performance of the organization (this will be addressed
later on) presents a good opportunity to consider if the scope of the innovation
management system remains adequate for the purpose of the organization.

### Deploying your innovation management system

_Do you think that your organization has adequately defined the steps required
to establish, implement, maintain and improve the innovation manage-
ment system?_

When deploying the innovation management system, the organization should
consider the innovation management principles (IMP), since implementing an
innovation management system is nothing less than transforming the concepts
of the principles into operational structures and processes. The aim is to impact
the organization’s culture and maintain it in the long term.
An innovation management system is constituted of different elements, each
of them fulfilling a particular aspect in the process of realizing value. The
organization can adopt these elements gradually according to its context, strat-
egy and resources, but it has to be kept in mind that the maximum benefits are
obtained when all elements are deployed and interact holistically as shown in
the figure below (see **Figure 7** ).

Your organization should follow these steps when setting up its innovation man-
agement system:

- identify the innovation activities that can be structured into processes of the
    innovation management system;
- determine interactions and interrelations of these activities, considering itera-
    tive aspects;
- make the system visible by mapping its main activities;
- determine the methods and criteria needed to ensure the effective operation
    and control of these activities;
- ensure the availability of resources and information required to support the
    operation and monitoring of these activities;
- assess the performance of the innovation management system and implement
    the actions required to achieve the intended results and improve the effective-
    ness of the innovation management system;
- establish and document the mechanisms for the protection and exploitation
    of results;

```

- address and balance the opportunities and risks;
- assign responsibilities and authorities; and
- determine the level of documented information needed.

The organization should try to keep documentation at the
minimum level to ensure the effectiveness of the innovation
management system without taking the risk of stifling innova-
tion dynamics.

### Innovation culture

_Do you consider that your organization promotes an organizational culture
that supports innovation activities?_

Culture is sometimes seen as an elusive concept. Here it refers to the shared behav-
iours, values, and beliefs of an organization or a community. It is one of the most
important aspects in creating an innovative organization, so much so that Peter
Drucker said: “Culture eats strategy for breakfast and technology for lunch and
everything else for dinner.”
Any organization, indeed, may succeed in carrying out an innovation initiative
once. However, to transform itself into an innovative organization requires a
culture with defined attributes.
The desirable attributes are not always present in the organization and are some-
times even resisted by the organization itself.
Nurturing a culture where innovation activities are embedded in the day-to-day
operations of the organization is an integral part of the implementation of the
innovation management system and should be a permanent goal of the organiza-
tion. Furthermore, it has to be understood that this is not an overnight task and
top management should be aware that time and commitment would be required
from their side to succeed in achieving this goal.
An organization may have relied on events such as developing a brilliant idea that
someone had when taking a shower, asking a group of employees to participate in
a creative workshop, or even carrying out a structured innovation initiative. Such
isolated events are not indicators that an innovation culture is being developed
or embedded in the organization.
Even when the organization has been working hard and for a long time on improv-
ing the effectiveness of their processes and increasing the profits or outputs from
the existing offerings, it may have developed some reluctance to take risks, be
creative, and work on scenarios of high uncertainty. These issues should be con-
sidered when the organization starts working on fostering an innovation culture.

```
ISO Store Order: OP-730034 license #1/ Downloaded: 2023-11-15

```

Moreover, it has to be remembered also that organizations do not exist only to
innovate. They have to deliver their established offerings to their current interested
parties. Consequently, the organization needs an operational culture to help it to
focus on continuously improving the effectiveness and efficiency of its operations
as well as the satisfaction of their customers, users, etc. This operational drive
is part of the innovation culture. The organization has to be creative as well as
efficient and customer-focused.
If we consider the IMP, it is clear that applying and deploying them throughout
the organization would contribute significantly to fostering a strong innovation
culture.
Focusing the organization on identifying, developing and deploying new solutions
to realize value would require the following from the organization:

- providing a work environment characterized by openness, curiosity, collabora-
    tion and networking among different interested parties (internal and external);
- encouraging creativity, change, and challenging current assumptions through
    experimentation, risk taking, and learning from failure;
- balancing assumption-based and evidence-based analysis;
- supporting leaders to ensure that they promote and demonstrate their com-
    mitment to innovation activities;
- allowing time and other resources for innovation activities as well as support-
    ing guides, tools, and methods;
- supporting the development of competencies which support innovation activi-
    ties such as training innovators, managers and other roles related to innovation
    activities;
- clarifying how persons in the organization and other interested parties can
    (be allowed or expected to) contribute to innovation activities;
- engaging people in providing and managing structures for multidiscipli-
    nary collaboration, to enable the coexistence of and the effective transitions
    between creative and operations-oriented mindsets;
- encouraging and striving to obtain diversity, respect and inclusiveness of
    different people, disciplines and perspectives;

```

- assessing the innovation culture and innovation performance using relevant
    innovation performance indicators;
- supporting and recognizing innovators, innovative behaviours and innovation
    initiatives and communicating successful innovation stories; and
- providing relevant incentives (not only monetary) for innovation achievements.

Organizations very often resist any initiative to change, captured by the notion
of “this is not the way we do things here”.
So, to a certain degree, the existence of constructive conflict could challenge the
status quo, encourage the debate and trigger creativity, which are all essential
elements for innovation activities.

### Collaboration

_Are you satisfied with the internal and external collaborative dynamics of your
organization?_

In order to identify new opportunities for innovation and innovate quickly, organi-
zations need to identify potential interested parties with which to collaborate,
and effective processes to achieve this. Usually, innovation initiatives require the
participation of different areas within the organization, as well as with suppliers,
research centres, government agencies, and other relevant interested parties.
Collaboration helps organizations to share and access knowledge, compe-
tences and other intellectual assets and resources. Thus, establishing effective
approaches to collaborate within the organization is essential for innovation
to succeed.
In order to implement effective approaches for collaboration, the organization
should consider the following:

- the need for internal and external collaboration based on the innovation strat-
    egy, existing resources, including knowledge and competencies;
- the diversity of experiences, disciplines, competencies, perspectives, etc.,
    when establishing collaboration;
- determining the methods for collaboration with external organizations, e.g.
    partnership, open innovation, and alliances;
- the importance of respect, openness, and trust between parties to encourage
    people, teams, and organizations to collaborate, e.g. foster collaboration as
    part of the organizational culture; and
- issues of IP (see the subsection on Intellectual property management, under
    Section K, Innovation management).

Collaboration may also be done in different fields and areas of expertise or needs
such as:

- identifying user needs, expectations and challenges;

```
```
ISO Store Order: OP-730034 license #1/ Downloaded: 2023-11-15
Single user licence only, copying and networking prohibited.
```

- sharing of ideas, knowledge and know-how;
- access to infrastructure;
- access to portfolios, markets, and users;
- acquiring new skills and resources; and
- jointly executing innovation activities.

The organization may address collaboration approaches when the innovation
initiative has been agreed and its different stages are defined. Collaboration can
involve people from different teams within the organization, as well as users, part-
ners, suppliers and other relevant parties. Thus, its roles, responsibilities, authori-
ties and activities should be defined as well as the communication channels.

### Leadership and commitment

_Do you consider that top management demonstrates commitment to the innova-
tion management system and its processes?_

Leadership is one of the fundamental principles of management systems. Appro-
priate leadership at all levels of the organization establishes unity of purpose and
direction, thus creating the conditions in which people are engaged in achieving
the organization’s innovation objectives.

In order that an innovation management system produces the desired outcomes,
top management should be completely involved and show commitment to innova-
tion and the system itself by:

- being accountable for the effectiveness and efficiency of the innovation man-
    agement system;
- ensuring that the innovation vision, strategy, policy, and objectives are estab-
    lished, consistent and compatible with the context and the strategic direction
    of the organization;
- fostering a culture supporting innovation activities;
- ensuring the adoption and integration of the organization’s innovation man-
    agement system requirements into the organization’s existing structures and
    business processes, as appropriate;
- ensuring that resources needed for the innovation management system are
    available;
- creating awareness and communicating the importance of effective innovation
    management and of adopting the innovation management system guidance;
- ensuring that the innovation management system achieves its intended
    outcomes;
- engaging, directing, and supporting people to contribute to the effectiveness
    of the innovation management system;

```
```
ISO Store Order: OP-730034 license #1/ Downloaded: 2023-11-15
Single user licence only, copying and networking prohibited.
```

- encouraging and recognizing innovators who demonstrate good practices,
    ensure engagement, and facilitate learning from both successes and failures;
- promoting performance evaluation at planned intervals and continual
    improvement of the innovation management system;
- ensuring the promotion of, and commitment to: a culture of creativity, value
    focus, openness and collaboration, conflict consciousness, tolerance of failure
    and learning throughout the organization; and
- recognizing innovators, innovative behaviours and innovation initiatives
    by directing and supporting people to contribute to the effectiveness of the
    innovation management system.

No innovation management system can be effective and sustainable without top
management support and commitment.

### Vision and strategy

_Do you consider that your organization’s vision and innovation strategy are
effectively communicated and understood within your organization?_

The organization should not embark on the innovation journey if there is not a
clear vision of innovation. An innovation vision should give clear indications
about the prime reasons for innovating and how innovation activities would
contribute to the overall performance of the organization. The innovation vision
should be aligned with the overall organizational vision.
Once an inspiring vision is formulated, people can be creative and innovative in
moving towards it.
The vision is the starting point for the innovation strategy, innovation policy,
objectives and indicators. The key performance indicators of the organization
will measure how progress is made in meeting the goals that ultimately flow
from the vision.
Consequently, the vision should:

- set a direction and a challenge that can inspire people to commit and to work
    towards it and that can be communicated externally to engage interested
    parties or raise reputational benefits;
- be ambitious and challenging and not constrained by the organization’s cur-
    rent capabilities; and
- provide a framework for setting innovation strategy and policy, against which
    progress can be measured.

Once the vision has been set, the organization should establish the strategy to
achieve it. The innovation strategy should be aligned with the overall strategy
of the organization and should describe why innovation activities are important
for the organization.
The strategy should be flexible and adaptable and change as a result of feedback
and performance of innovation activities. Good practices recommend the strategy
to be communicated to, and understood by, relevant interested parties.

```
ISO 56002:2019 | Innovation management system – a practical guide – 55
```
```
ISO Store Order: OP-730034 license #1/ Downloaded: 2023-11-15
Single user licence only, copying and networking prohibited.
```

The strategy should clearly define what kinds of innovations the organization is
going to pursue (incremental, breakthrough, disruptive) and on what it is going
to innovate (process, products, services, business models). Otherwise, people
could be confused about what they should do, and resources may not be spent
on projects aligned with the organizational goals and objectives.
The innovation vision and strategy are usually kept as documented information.
The vision is generally made public while the innovation strategy can be more of
an in-house document shared with selected interested parties.
Establishing both the vision and the strategy is a team effort. We consider that
facilitation by a third external party, not involved in the internal processes, helps
to balance participation and avoid one participant’s opinion prevailing over the
rest. It is an exercise that could take somewhere between two or four meetings,
carried out during a two- to three-week period, for example. It is recommended to
give time between meetings to allow participants to mature the ideas expressed
and agreed upon in previous meetings. Meetings should not last more than three
or four hours. Both the innovation vision and the strategy have to be clear and
easy to convey.

### Innovation policy

_Do you consider that your organization’s innovation policy is effectively com-
municated and understood?_

The innovation policy, together with the innovation strategy, provides a frame-
work to establish goals and objectives. Establishing an innovation policy sup-
ported by top management can ensure that resources to fund innovation projects
and functions will be allocated.
The organization has to set a very clear direction and objectives to transform into
an innovative organization. Having an innovation vision, strategy and policy
defines where you would like to be, how to go there, and what principles and
approaches will guide your journey to that destination.
Likewise, having the full weight of the highest level of authority behind a policy
signals that it is not just a good idea but an essential one for the organization. It
means that there are specific and certain expectations that must be met and that
innovation activities are not just another “flavour of the month”. Organizations
seeking to establish an innovation management system should set the innovation
policy and get it approved at the beginning of the journey. It has to be a multi-
year policy, not just for one cycle. The policy should be written using a language
understood by the organization, by the sector the organization belongs to, and
by the relevant interested parties.
Another important point is that the innovation strategy and policy should be
communicated very clearly to all people in the organization, so they know what
the innovation strategy and policy are about and how they can contribute to
innovation activities.
This communication process should also be extended to all relevant interested
parties to ensure that the entire value chain and network of associates, partners,
and subcontractors, etc., understand where the organization is heading and what
it is looking for.

```

If the organization has implemented other management systems to address further
aspects of the organization, such as quality, environment, safety, etc., then it may
be worth considering issuing an integrated policy.
Finally, establishing an innovation policy supported by top management can
ensure that resources to fund innovation projects and functions will be allocated.

### Organizational structure, roles, responsibilities and authorities

_Do you think that the organizational structure, roles, responsibilities and
authorities related to the innovation management system are properly defined?_

Top management should establish specific responsibilities and authorities for the
identified roles and ensure that members of the organization are aware of their
assignments through effective communications activities (e.g. through the use of
relevant documented information, such as job descriptions, work instructions,
duty statements, organization charts, manuals, or procedures).
Responsibilities and authorities can be assigned to one or more persons for exist-
ing and dedicated roles with a focus on general innovation management or specific
innovation initiatives and activities, to ensure that:

- risk taking, learning from failure, creativity, and value focus become part of
    organizational culture;
- processes are adaptable and delivering their intended outputs;
- performance reporting and improvement opportunities of the innovation
    management system are submitted in a timely manner to top management;
- the integrity of the innovation management system is maintained when
    changes to the innovation management system are planned and imple-
    mented; and
- the innovation management system follows the guidance of ISO 56002:2019.

It is essential to emphasize that although authority can be delegated, the overall
responsibility and accountability for the innovation management system remains
with top management.
In some organizations, there could be a limited number of people with the required
competences available to carry out the tasks required. Therefore, it could be use-
ful to plan for sharing roles and responsibilities. Such plans are valuable when
managers are away from the facility, e.g. during holidays or in cases of accident
or illness.

```

Performing the above tasks is not easy if the individuals selected are not true
believers of the need to innovate and do not have appropriate communication
and assessment skills. In this sense, selecting a person(s) with seniority within
the organization is advisable.
It should be noted that this person, in most cases, does not have authority over
the rest of the personnel. They would guide by example and persuasion.

### Actions to address opportunities and risks

_Do you think that your organization determines the opportunities and risks to
be addressed when planning for the innovation management system?_

Risk management is an important part of any management system. Reducing the
risk is a natural approach for most enterprises.
However, risk and innovation are linked. An opportunity may be hidden behind
any risk and developing a successful innovation without taking any risk may
not be possible. The important aspect is to identify the risks and to balance risk
and opportunity.
When planning for the development of the innovation management system, an
organization should define its risk appetite. Depending on the innovation ambi-
tion, the types of innovation it seeks to achieve and in particular the context,
an organization may need to accept and prepare themselves to accept different
levels of risk taking.
When the organization identifies a field of opportunity or when it develops an
innovation initiative, it should identify the related risks, quantify them as much as
possible and finally decide whether the opportunity should be pursued or stopped.
Risks and opportunities should be monitored along innovation initiatives and
processes to ease the management of uncertainty that is associated with creative
and examination activities. Information available from a specific context will
help assertive decision-making.
The actions that an organization can take to address risks will depend on the
nature of the risk, for example:

```
ISO 56002:2019 | Innovation management system – a practical guide – 61
```
```
ISO Store Order: OP-730034 license #1/ Downloaded: 2023-11-15
Single user licence only, copying and networking prohibited.
```

- avoiding the risk, by no longer performing the innovation projects where that
    risk can be encountered;
- controlling/minimizing the risk, for example, by using documented proce-
    dures, making additional revisions or controls, utilizing more solid techniques
    during the idea generation phase, etc.;
- sharing the risk, e.g. by working with partners on a consortium to reduce the
    potential impact of, for example, financial losses;
- taking no action, where the organization accepts the risk itself, based on its
    potential effect or the cost of the needed action; and
- accepting the risk of performing the innovation projects since the risk to the
    organization of not performing them is considered to be higher.

Furthermore, the level of documentation needed to carry out these activities
varies from one organization to another, depending on the culture and degree
of control wanted. This is usually an Achilles heel in many organizations which
lack the competences for carrying out a comprehensive and useful risk analysis.
Training or external help could be required at this stage of the process until this
capability is well developed and the organization can act by itself.

### Innovation objectives

_Do you consider that your organization has established innovation objectives
aligned with the innovation strategy and policy, and has developed plans to
achieve them?_

“An elephant can be eaten one piece at a time” is a familiar analogy. Once your
organization has a vision (setting the place where it aspires to be) and a strategy
(establishing the pathway to follow to reach that place), the next step is to decide
the objectives that would help you to follow the pathway without losing the direc-
tion and encouraging you to pursue that direction every time you reach a set
milestone. It is important to set innovation objectives to:

- provide guidance and direction;
- facilitate planning;
- motivate and inspire employees: and
- help organizations evaluate and control innovation performance.

Setting innovation objectives at relevant levels of the organization provides a
framework for translating the organization’s vision and strategy into smaller
chunks that are then assigned or delegated to individual persons. This needs
to be completed because an organization achieves its overall objectives to the
extent that each person does his or her part in completing the right job tasks in
an effective way.
Clear objectives allow the organization to monitor the deployment of the innova-
tion strategy continuously and make the necessary corrections when the organi-
zation detects a trend showing a risk of the innovation strategy going off track.
Several theories and methods exist to define objectives. One of the most common
approaches is probably the “SMART Goals”. This approach uses a mnemonic
acronym to prompt that objectives should always be:

- Specific – target a specific area for improvement.
- Measurable – quantify or at least suggest an indicator of progress.
- Assignable – specify who will do it.

```
ISO 56002:2019 | Innovation management system – a practical guide – 63
```
```
ISO Store Order: OP-730034 license #1/ Downloaded: 2023-11-15
Single user licence only, copying and networking prohibited.
```

- Realistic – state what results can be realistically achieved, given avail-
    able resources.
- Time-related – specify when the result(s) can be achieved.

Following best practices, innovation objectives should:

- be consistent with the innovation vision, strategy and policy, i.e. when estab-
    lishing the innovation objectives, the organization needs to use the innovation
    strategy and policy as a framework to ensure objectives are aligned;
- determine which are the driving factors and innovation enablers, as well as
    what will be done in terms of focus areas, planning horizons and types of
    innovations targeted;
- consider what resources will be required, what types of collaborations and
    alliances are needed;
- be measurable, establishing what has to be achieved over a certain period of
    time using both quantitative methods and qualitative ones;
- address applicable requirements from all interested parties, including those
    set by the organization itself;
- be monitored and/or reviewed for progress being made in achieving the inno-
    vation objective; this could be carried out through any suitable means, includ-
    ing progress reports, customer/partner feedback or management reviews, etc.;
- be communicated as necessary − the organization should communicate its
    innovation objectives throughout the organization and to relevant interested
    parties, as necessary, for example, through meetings to inform relevant per-
    sons of the innovation objectives related to their activities or notifying part-
    ners/associates in an innovation project about expected delays in achieving
    some project milestones; and
- be updated as appropriate.

### Portfolio management

_Do you consider that your organization successfully manages and regularly
evaluates and prioritizes the portfolio of innovation initiatives?_

Depending on its innovation dynamic, an organization may have from just a few
innovation initiatives to a large number of them being developed simultaneously.
Furthermore, it should be remembered that innovation activities may cover a
broad area that includes everything from developing a new packaging to introduc-
ing a radical new cancer treatment. Consequently, managing the organization’s
portfolio of innovation initiatives is in the best interest of the organization to
ensure it produces the highest overall return while maintaining alignment with
the organization’s appetite for risk. If the organization does not have an approach
to manage its portfolios of innovation initiatives, it might end up with a collection
of ad hoc, stand-alone efforts that compete with one another for time, money,
attention, and prestige. Ensuring that its innovation portfolio is aligned with
its innovation strategy and has consistency between innovation initiatives will
help to optimize resources and assets through realization of synergies, re-use of
technologies, infrastructures or processes.
Portfolios of innovation should be well-balanced. The balance depends on several
variables, depending on the strategy of each organization, such as:

- Categories of innovations – products, processes, services, and business models
    innovation.
- Sources of innovation – by balancing internal innovations and external inno-
    vations in which you have invested, have options to pick up, or are tracking.
- Degrees of novelty, time horizon and the ambition of the innovations.

The Innovation Matrix (By Greg Satell – _Mapping innovation: A playbook for navi-
gating a disruptive age_ ) and the Innovation Ambition Matrix (By Bansi Nagji and
Geoff Tuff – _Managing your innovation portfolio, Harvard Business Review_ ) can
help you to position your innovations under those criteria.

As in any other management system, measurements are key to determine if goals
are being achieved. This is especially true when speaking about innovation initia-
tives. It is necessary to measure innovation at the process and project level and at
the portfolio level. This helps to ensure alignment among top management that the
organization is taking on the appropriate amount of risk, as well as that the indi-
vidual projects will take the organization in the direction of the strategy. Innova-
tion portfolio metrics/indicators assist in the aligning of organizational priorities.
By setting up metrics for managing innovation portfolios, the organization could
monitor the risk level and balance it accordingly. For example, a portfolio with a
high percentage of core projects will not make a drastic impact in the market or on
users. On the other hand, a portfolio with too many transformational innovation
projects may increase the risk above the acceptable level for the organization.
Innovation portfolio metrics should not be considered only from a financial per-
spective. The aim of focusing on innovation is to produce value and, while this
value could be financial, it could also be related to acquiring knowledge, gaining a
competitive advantage, developing employee commitment, prepare the company
for the future, etc. Thus, the portfolio metrics should be adapted to the organiza-
tion’s strategy and be regularly updated.
Innovation portfolio metrics can be considered at the project level, portfolio level
and/or company level and could be:

- predicted revenue/earnings (annual and cumulative);
- expected degree of variability in revenue/earnings;
- number of long-, medium- and short-term projects;
- amount of investment;
- innovation-type portfolio mix (incremental, expansion, disruptive);
- type and amount of risk (market, technical, operational/executional − high,
    medium and low); and
- resource constraints.

The metrics should regularly be reviewed and, depending on the level of maturity
and complexity of the innovation management system, they could be centralized
from a simple report to a scorecard.

## Enabling innovation

To enable innovation, the innovation management system should provide ade-
quate support. There are many different types of support for innovation, includ-
ing resources (people, knowledge, infrastructure, and finance), competence,
communication and awareness, tools and methods, as well as approaches for
strategic intelligence and IP management (see **Figure 10** ).

### Resources

_Are you satisfied with the way your organization determines and assigns the
resources needed to implement, maintain, and improve the innovation man-
agement system?_

Each management system needs resources to operate effectively and allocat-
ing them is one of the non-delegable responsibilities of top management. The
resources for implementing and maintaining an innovation management system
may include, but are not limited to, human resources, infrastructure, equipment,
knowledge, and information.
In order to allocate the appropriate resources for the innovation management
system, the organization should consider:

- a proactive, transparent, flexible, and adaptable approach for providing
    resources;
- the capabilities of, and limitations on, existing internal support;
- what needs to be obtained from external providers, e.g. by outsourcing or
    partnering;
- internal and external collaboration, e.g. sharing or re-use, to optimize the
    use of resources;
- securing resources for innovation activities separated from other activities; and
- the long-term build-up of capabilities for innovation activities.

When innovation initiatives begin, the organization should plan and allocate
resources to assure it will be possible to finish them.

### People

_Do you consider that your organization has the necessary, trained people for the
effective implementation and operation of its innovation management system?_

People are probably the most important resource for an innovation management
system and their commitment to and involvement within innovation initiatives
are crucial to achieving success.
Top management should determine and provide the necessary personnel to ensure
that the innovation management system is implemented and maintained effec-
tively. Also, top management should encourage the active participation of the
organization’s personnel in innovation activities, providing the required time to
conduct them and, when necessary, training should also be provided.
In order to have a focus on the engagement of people, the organization
should consider:

- the need to attract, recruit, and retain people;
- forming teams with a mix of people from different disciplines and with diverse
    personal attributes and backgrounds, to encourage cross-pollination that can
    result in unexpected positive outcomes;
- establishing appropriate incentives, including non-financial incentives, e.g.
    rewards and recognition;
- protecting innovators, given the potential higher degree of risk of innovation
    activities; and
- establishing and communicating the terms and conditions for the ownership
    of ideas, handling of patents and exploitation of innovations, which can be
    subject to different national laws, regulations, and other agreements.

It is expected that if the organization is determined to transform itself into an
innovative organization, personnel should have time dedicated to innovation
activities, including top management.
Some very well-known innovative organizations allow and encourage their
employees to invest some of their working time on innovation activities. For

```

example, Google looks for recruits who have off- the-wall hobbies and unconven-
tional interests — people who are not afraid to defy conventional wisdom — and,
after they are hired, it encourages them to spend up to 20 % of their time working
on whatever they feel will benefit Google’s users and advertisers.
Another good example is 3M, where its engineers and scientists can spend up
to 15 % of their time pursuing projects of their own choice. They can look for
unexpected, unscripted opportunities, for breakthrough innovations that have
the potential to expand the business for the company. The benefits from these
focused innovation activities in these enterprises are also very well known. Each
organization should look for its own approach to engaging people in innovation,
but it should not expect important outcomes if dedicated people and time are not
allocated to these activities.
It is also important to be aware that some effective innovation teams are made up
of a mix of people from different disciplines and backgrounds, and organizations
would need to put in place processes to attract, recruit and retain them. Succeeding
in getting the right people is a challenge, but keeping them in the organization
is even more difficult.

### Infrastructure

_Can you confirm that your organization has determined, provided, and main-
tained the necessary infrastructure for the effective implementation of its
innovation management system?_

The innovation management system, as with any other management system,
requires the infrastructure for operating and delivering expected outputs. This
should not be overlooked when the system is implemented and when different
innovation initiatives are pursued. It is important to determine the necessary
infrastructure to conduct innovation initiatives as soon as they are agreed, so
that top management can allocate the necessary resources.
Infrastructure may be dedicated to innovation or be shared within the organi-
zation (e.g. use of production tools for prototyping, use of dedicated rooms for
creativity sessions). When making decisions about allocating infrastructure, the
organization has to consider factors such as flexibility, cost effectiveness, and
coordination benefits.
Also, top management should consider and evaluate the benefits of obtaining
the necessary infrastructure from external interested parties by such means as
outsourcing or partnering.
The infrastructure to support and operate the innovation management system
may include:

- buildings, facilities and associated utilities, e.g. creative environments,
    research and development (R&D) laboratories, maker spaces, simulation
    laboratories, and living laboratories;
- research and simulation equipment, physical tools, other hardware, software,
    methods, advanced technologies and models;
- transportation resources;
- information and communication technology, e.g. for the management of col-
    laboration, ideas, portfolios, insights, talent, projects, and programmes; and
- networks, e.g. knowledge networks, and market networks.

### Finance

_Do you consider that your organization has determined and provided the nec-
essary financial resources for the effective implementation of its innovation
management system?_

Similar to infrastructure, financial resources are required for the operation of the
innovation management system.
As organizations may be running different innovation initiatives at the same
time, covering different types of innovations with different degrees of risks, a
careful approach to funding them should be developed, to ensure that all initia-
tives have the financial support needed during all phases of their development
and deployment. When allocating funding, the following should be considered:

- the financial opportunities, risks and constraints associated with inno-
    vation activities, including the financial implications and other risks of
    not innovating;
- establishing funding principles, e.g. central financial resources versus funding
    through local or operational budgets;
- allocating dedicated financial resources for innovation activities, e.g. as a
    percentage of annual budget or designating funds for innovation initiatives
    by top management;
- identifying and accessing relevant financial resources outside the organiza-
    tion, e.g. from private and public investors, research agencies, partners, co-
    sponsors, innovation grants, tax credits for R&D, or crowdsourcing;
- establishing investment principles, e.g. investing in internal versus exter-
    nal activities, investing in start-ups, corporate venture capital, or innova-
    tion accelerators;
- the balance of funding across different time horizons, different degrees of
    risk and different types of innovations, e.g. incremental innovation or radi-
    cal innovation;

```

- ensuring the funding of other relevant resources and support, e.g. people,
    time, infrastructure, or competence; and
- ensuring that the funding approach covers all activities needed.

Many organizations set up a funding board to manage their financial resources
to ensure they are well managed.

### Competence

_Do you think that your organization has established the competencies required
for the effective implementation, maintenance and improvement of its innova-
tion management system?_

To innovate effectively, organizations should engage different people at different
stages of the processes. At each stage, defined competencies are needed to ensure
that work can be done as planned.
The innovation competencies that organizations need may include:

- strategic (e.g. planning and change management);
- operational (e.g. designing, prototyping, producing and supply);
- engineering (e.g. project management and testing);
- commercial (e.g. market introduction and value realization);
- technical (e.g. IP and strategic intelligence);
- management (e.g. leadership and team building); and
- soft (e.g. idea generation and managing creative people).

When conducting innovation initiatives, organizations need to identify their
existing competencies and analyse them against what is required. Generally,
the gap between the competencies that the organization has and those that are
required should be identified. Top management should take action to close this
gap. Such action may include:

- upgrading the existing competencies, e.g. by providing training, reassigning
    currently employed people, or hiring new people; and
- outsourcing innovation activities through collaboration with universities,
    research centres, consulting and servicing enterprises, etc.

Determining the necessary competencies is not the only task the organization should
do. It is also critical to ensure that the necessary collaborations between people with
different competencies take place and that different competencies are combined to
achieve the full potential of the collective competence of the organization.

### Awareness

_Do you consider that your organization has ensured that all people doing work
under its control are aware of the innovation vision, strategy and policy, as well
as their responsibilities within the innovation management system?_

So that people working to the innovation management system are committed
to innovation initiatives and the system itself, organizations should ensure that
people are aware of:

- the innovation vision, strategy, policy and objectives;
- the meaning and importance of innovation for the organization;
- their contribution to the effectiveness and efficiency of the innovation man-
    agement system, including the benefits of improved innovation performance;
- the implications of not meeting the innovation management system; and
- the availability of support for innovation activities.

Sometimes, people do not follow procedures or instructions because they are not
aware of the consequences of their actions for the innovation management system.
Top management should implement actions so that people in the organization are
aware of these potential consequences. These actions may include establishing
an awareness programme that may include:

- identifying the target audience and developing messages aligned with the
    innovation vision and strategy;
- communicating the benefits of managing innovation with a systematic
    approach and why people should pay attention to it; and
- creating a team with the technical and communications competencies to carry
    out the programme.

Some ideas to consider in communicating the awareness programme may include:

- creating poster boards and signs to hang up round the organization;
- including articles about the innovation management system and innovation
    initiatives in the organization’s newsletter, if there is one;

```

- carrying out brief talks, seminars, blogs, etc., on the topic;
- including innovation topics regularly on the news board of the organization’s
    Website; and
- having casual meetings with personnel and discussing innovation manage-
    ment system issues.

### Communication

Do you consider that your organization has determined the internal and external
communications that are relevant to the innovation management system?
Communication plays a very critical role in the effectiveness of any management
system, innovation included. Consequently, any MSS requires activities regard-
ing how to approach communication. The organization should ensure that every
time it communicates anything related to the innovation management system,
the following issues are considered:

- what will be communicated;
- why to communicate;
- when to communicate;
- with whom to communicate;
- how to communicate; and
- who communicates.

Communication serves various purposes: creating awareness, increasing people
engagement, preparing for action, establishing thought leadership, influencing,
building brand value, etc. However, the organization should take into considera-
tion that communication topics may differ for internal and external parties. For
example, the organization could communicate the status of innovation manage-
ment system corrective actions within the organization while communicating with
external partners or associates about the innovation projects being developed on
a collaborative basis. It is very important that the organization determines the
relevant internal and external parties with whom it needs to communicate, to
ensure the effective operation of the innovation management system. This may
include relevant people within organizations at all levels and relevant interested
parties (such as customers, partners, associates, government, and participants
in collaborative innovation projects).

Different communication methods are often required for different situations,
including formal and informal ones. Some examples of communication methods
are:

- team meetings;
- notice boards;
- intranet;
- newsletters;
- games;
- magazines;
- staff conferences;
- Websites;
- annual reports;
- white papers;
- briefings to financial institutions, customers, users, partner, suppliers, and
    other interested parties;
- advertising;
- press releases;
- trade shows; and professional conferences.

### Documented information

_Do you consider that your organization has established policies and procedures
to ensure that documented information is controlled?_

The goal of having documented information is to set the basic guidance to preserve
knowledge and good practices within the innovation management system.
Most management systems couldn ́t effectively work without some documented
information associated with them. This is not necessarily only referring to
high-level documents such as the management system policy or the objectives,
which are often required for a management system developed in line with the
ISO harmonized structure. Procedures, instructions, records, minutes, reports,
etc., related to the innovation management system should also be documented.
In all cases, the organization should strive to keep the documented information
at a minimum level.
The amount of documented information is influenced by the size of the organiza-
tion and the types of activities and offerings it has. Also, the complexity of the
processes and their interrelations as well as the competences of the personnel
will influence the amount of documented information required.
Having said that, if you will have documented information related to the imple-
mented innovation management system, you should set up a process addressing
the creation, distribution, access, retrieval and use, storage and preservation,
updating, control of changes, and retention and deposition of all documented
information pertaining to the innovation management system. This is applicable
to internal as well as external documented information.
Usually, you should develop a procedure where your policy to address the above
issues is defined. You only have to follow the guidelines set up in ISO 56002:2019,
addressing each of the points that are mentioned.
Remember that documented information can change as an organization improves
its processes and its innovation management system. So, historical documented
information should be maintained, stored, and retrieved in order to keep track

```

of previous developments; saving some ideas that have not been developed (e.g.
due to unfeasibility or strategic analysis) is important in order to analyse them
later on. Consideration should be given to version control, where the organiza-
tion determines some means of identifying current from obsolete documented
information and establishes controls to ensure that only current documented
information is used.
The storage of obsolete documented information can be important. The docu-
mented information should be maintained in an appropriate medium to ensure
its preservation and legibility. The retention time for documented information
could be a statutory or regulatory requirement, a contractual requirement, or can
be determined by the organization (depending on the lifetime of its offerings).

### Tools and methods

_Do you consider that your organization has determined, provided and main-
tained the necessary tools and methods for developing, maintaining and
improving the innovation management system?_

An organization does not have to reinvent the wheel to perform innovation
efficient ly.
A wide range of tools and methods is already available to support the organization
in every innovation activity or process at any stage of the innovation path, from
opportunity identification to solution deployment.
The organization should determine, provide, and maintain the necessary tools
and methods for developing, maintaining and improving the innovation manage-
ment system.
The organization should consider:

- selecting and providing a mix of appropriate tools and methods supporting
    innovation activities, as well as for different types of innovations;
- creating awareness of, ensuring access to, and providing training for the avail-
    able tools and methods; and
- sharing, reusing and collaborating in the use of tools and methods.

Tools and methods can be of different types, including descriptive, provocative,
participative, challenging, analytical and communicative. They can take many
forms and formats, including guides, instructions, games, templates, presenta-
tions, videos, software, and hardware.
Examples of tools and methods are back-casting, ethnographic research, scenario
planning, brainstorming, idea management, inclusive design, and business model
templates.
For additional guidance on tools and methods you could consult documents
already developed and in continuous development by ISO/TC 279, such as
the following:

### Strategic intelligence management

_Do you consider that your organization has established an approach for the
management of strategic intelligence?_

In the new “era of knowledge”, organizations need to utilize data, information and
knowledge to respond to changes in their environment (such as technological,
market, regulatory, policy, etc.) and to define their organizational and innova-
tion strategy.
To this extent, it is necessary to isolate or synthesize data and information with
high confidence and to convert it into knowledge for making strategic decisions
and to take advantage of untapped opportunities.
Strategic intelligence is the outcome of a structured process for collecting,
processing and communicating data, information and knowledge to decision-
makers, which can be applied continuously or on specific innovation initiatives
to be launched.
The backbone of the process rests on ensuring objectivity and adequacy of scope
and criteria, reliability of data sources and the information derived from them,
and transparency of the actions performed to interpret and communicate the
knowledge.
An organization can leverage strategic intelligence as an enabling factor to achieve
its business objectives and to implement innovation initiatives for a range of
purposes such as:

- identifying new business opportunities;
- increasing competitive advantage;
- anticipating risk and uncertainty;
- enabling technology transfer opportunities;
- forecasting technological and business drivers;
- identifying weak signals to anticipate change;
- overcoming barriers that limit value creation; and
- implementing a structured approach to problem solving.

```

```
```
ISO Store Order: OP-730034 license #1/ Downloaded: 2023-11-15
Single user licence only, copying and networking prohibited.
```

In order to do this, the organization should establish an approach for the manage-
ment of strategic intelligence that considers:

- the need to acquire intelligence from internal and external sources;
- the need to collaborate with relevant interested parties;
- the use of tools and methods, e.g. data mining, analytics, prediction markets;
- different perspectives, e.g. present and future, internal and external; and
- the need for developing influencing activities to increase acceptance of
    innovations.
Strategic intelligence can include activities to acquire, collect, interpret, analyse,
evaluate, apply, and deliver to (or share between) decision-makers and other
interested parties the necessary data, information, and knowledge.
For additional guidance on strategic intelligence you could consult CEN/TS 16555-
2:2014, _Innovation management — Part 2: Strategic intelligence management_ , and
ISO 56006 (under development), _Innovation management — Tools and methods
for strategic intelligence management — Guidance_ , and/or get additional advice
from a subject expert.

### Intellectual property management

_Do you consider that your organization has established an approach for man-
aging IP issues?_

Every organization involved in innovation initiatives has to address IP, which
refers to the type of property. IPR are the rights arising from value generated by
human ingenuity, creativity and inventiveness through new knowledge, inven-
tions, creative expressions or, generally, output such as technological products or
processes, software, data, know-how, literary and artistic works, designs, symbols
and names.
IP is becoming increasingly important on a global scale in today’s knowledge-
based economy for both large and small organizations because it allows all organi-
zations to capture the benefits of innovation and it can facilitate co-developing,
exchanging and trading of ideas.
An organization can leverage IP to achieve its business objectives and to imple-
ment innovation initiatives for a range of purposes including:

- strategic positioning;
- finding routes to innovation;
- protecting innovation results;
- attracting and securing investment;
- increasing competitive advantage;
- establishing clear ownership of IP and IPR;
- establishing freedom to operate;
- creating innovation value; and
- enabling collaboration.

The organization should establish an approach for the management of IP that
aligns with, and supports, the innovation strategy, considering:

- what IP assets are to be, and not to be, protected and when, how, and where
    (e.g. patent, copyright, trademark, open-source licensing);

```
ISO 56002:2019 | Innovation management system – a practical guide – 85
```
```
ISO Store Order: OP-730034 license #1/ Downloaded: 2023-11-15
Single user licence only, copying and networking prohibited.
```

- the rationale for creating, protecting, and utilizing IP, (e.g. defend against
    infringement);
- the rationale for not protecting IP (e.g. confidentiality, cost, speed);
- if and how to establish and maintain an inventory of the organization’s intel-
    lectual assets;
- the need for managing, monitoring and analysing disclosed IP that is relevant
    for the organization;
- how to realize value from IP (e.g. through licensing, cross-licensing);
- establishing awareness and providing training in the organization about the
    approach;
- access or restriction to IP by persons, internally and externally;
- how to manage infringements, potential and actual, from other parties; and
- the development and differences of relevant national legislations and other
    internationally applicable legal requirements and compliance commitments.

IP can be used to achieve objectives such as brand building, differentiation and
positioning of offerings, customer loyalty, R&D, and revenue generation.
Organizations should be aware that considering IP only from a defensive perspec-
tive can obscure some benefits that IP can achieve, which may support additional
innovation and business objectives.
IP management can enable collaboration with partners, competitors, and custom-
ers, which can yield enhanced innovation outcomes. IP management can create
collective value through collaborative approaches (e.g. open innovation, joint
development, ecosystems, and network effects), and be a driver of additional
sources of revenue (e.g. cash flows through licensing).
For additional guidance you could consult CEN/TS 16555-4:2014, _Innovation man-
agement — Part 4: Intellectual property management_ , ISO 56005:2020, _Innovation
management — Tools and methods for intellectual property management — Guid-
ance_ , and/or get additional advice from a subject expert.

## Evaluating and improving the innovation management system

As soon as the innovation management system is put in place, a dynamic of con-
tinuous improvement should be launched. This will improve the performance of
the system and encourage the updating of your practices according to the evolution
of knowledge and tools for innovation (see **Figure 11** ).

### Monitoring, measuring, analysis and evaluation

_Do you consider that your organization has properly determined what has to
be monitored, measured, analysed, and evaluated to improve its innovation
management system?_

As every organization is different and may approach innovation from different per-
spectives and with different purposes, it is not easy to predetermine which activi-
ties are supposed to be monitored and which ones are supposed to be measured.
In the end, it’s up to the organization to establish what will be monitored and
what has to be measured, as well as deciding on the frequency at which those
activities would be carried out.
By having a clear image of the innovation activities and their interrelationships,
the organization would be able to define what monitoring and measurement
processes should be established to ensure a proper control of those activities.
Furthermore, it is important to define what value the organization would like to
realize through its innovation initiatives or innovation portfolios. Once this has
been defined, it could set up the measurements that have to be done to determine
if the value is actually realized.
The set of innovation performance indicators, quantitative or qualitative, can
include a balance of:

- input-related indicators (e.g. number of ideas, number of innovation initiatives);
- throughput-related indicators (e.g. speed of experimentation, learning and
    development, number or ratio of employees, time-to-profit, time-to-mar-
    ket); and
- output-related indicators (e.g. number or ratio of ideas implemented, return-
    on-innovation-investment, revenue and profit growth).

Innovation performance indicators can be applied at the system level (considering
the whole organization) or at the initiatives level (regarding one specific innova-
tion). They can focus on a specific activity, resource or process.

The output of these monitoring and measurement activities should feed the analy-
sis and evaluation processes that will allow the organization to determine the
performance and effectiveness of the innovation management system.
The following steps are recommended:

- determining what needs to be monitored and what needs to be measured,
    including which innovation performance indicators are to be used;
- establishing methods and criteria to be applied to carry out the monitoring,
    measurement, and analysis and evaluation activities;
- defining when monitoring and measurement would be performed;
- determining when the results from monitoring and measurement should be
    analysed and evaluated;
- determining who will be responsible;
- determining how the analysis and evaluation would be carried out; and
- deciding when, how and to whom the results of the analysis and evaluation
    would be reported.

The organization should determine what documented information of the above
steps has to be retained as evidence of the results. Likewise, some monitoring
and measurement methods would need to be documented to ensure repeatability
and traceability.

### Internal audit

_Do you consider that your organization uses an adequate approach for meas-
uring if the innovation management system is effectively implemented and
maintained?_

When an organization designs and implements an innovation management sys-
tem, it establishes a set of interrelated or interacting elements, procedures, and
processes and activities. During an audit, the following perspectives should be
examined:

- Intent − “Have you stated what you intend to do?” — do the defined or docu-
    mented processes adequately express your approach?
- Implementation − “Have you done what you stated?” — do the observed and
    recorded practices show conformity and coherence with the stated intent?
- Effectiveness − “Have you done it well?” — do the results of the process indi-
    cate that the desired outcomes have been achieved?

The ISO harmonized structure defines “effectiveness” as the extent to which
planned activities are realized and planned results are achieved. In other words,
to judge effectiveness you look not only at the conformity adequacy of a process,
but also at its results compared to its objectives.
“Audit” is defined as a systematic and independent process for obtaining evidence
and evaluating it objectively to determine the extent to which the audit criteria
are fulfilled.
Therefore, performing an internal audit allows the organization to verify if its
processes are operating as established, if its procedures are being followed as
determined, and if results are achieved as desired.
Best practices recommend conducting internal audits of your innovation man-
agement system at planned intervals, e.g. once or twice a year, depending on
the importance of the processes being audited and the results of the previous
audits, as well as the level of risk involved with the processes and the impact
they could have on the results. For example, more mature processes are likely to

```

require less frequent internal audits. More complex processes can require more
frequent internal audits.
A list of inputs to consider when planning, establishing, implementing, and main-
taining audits could include:

- relevance of the processes;
- managerial priorities;
- performance of the processes;
- changes affecting the organization;
- results from previous audits (e.g. history of problems);
- trends in customer complaints; and
- statutory and regulatory issues.

During an audit, the auditor has to gather objective evidence through direct obser-
vation of the process, interviews with relevant persons, and the examination of
documented information. It is important to have competent auditors. You could ask
for volunteers in your organization, people who like this kind of activity and, with
the appropriate training, could carry out the audit with the necessary competence,
impartiality, and objectivity. As the results of the internal audit form one of the
inputs to the management review meeting, it is important to ensure that the audit
is performed in the best possible way to ensure reliable data.
Internal audit is an excellent tool to determine the value of the innovation manage-
ment system, and top management should be very careful in the way findings are
treated to ensure that there are corrective actions to address them.
Likewise, top management should ensure that when a deviation is found during
an audit, the auditors evaluate if similar deviations could occur, or potentially
occur somewhere else. Remember, the innovation management system is a set of
processes that interact and are interconnected. Furthermore, when a corrective
action is implemented, its effectiveness should be checked, since not all solutions
work as planned.
It is especially important to note that even if the audit is conducted by a third
party, for an innovation management system we commonly refer to an “innova-
tion assessment” rather than an “innovation audit”

```

```
```

```

The key difference is the leap from an approach based on conformity/compliance,
up to the effectiveness and performance point of view, to an approach focused
on “consistency”. The latter focuses on relationships between the system ele-
ments, such as how the results are strictly connected to the approach and to the
implemented processes.
The main goal of an innovation assessment should be to identify the key factors
to better innovate rather than to verify its conformity to procedures based on a
pre-determined or a priori schema. It should evaluate the alignment between the
innovation ambition and the effectiveness of the innovation management system.
Assessment should be focused, by definition, on the evaluation of capabilities
of achieving innovation with a future perspective. It can be considered as an
“assumption-based process”. On the other hand, auditing is focused by definition
on objective evidence; an audit is an “evidence-based process”, more likely to rely
on outcomes and achieved results (i.e. past and present).
So, an innovation assessment could be based on relationships (e.g. people commit-
ted and involved in innovation initiatives, innovation partnerships for informa-
tion/knowledge, strategic intelligence, open innovation, communication, trade
and financial channels, as well as the interactions between them and the typical
elements of a management system); and their consistency with other strategic
aspects (e.g. organizational culture, overall business strategies, manufacturing
capability, as well as with socio-economic megatrends, technological maturity-
path, and technology road-mapping).
For additional guidance on innovation assessment you could consult CEN/
TS 16555-7:2015, _Innovation management — Innovation management assessment_ ,
and ISO/TR 56004:2019, _Innovation management assessment — Guidance_.

### Management review

_Do you consider that your organization has an adequate approach to determine
the adequacy of the innovation management system?_

Organizations have to regularly check if the innovation management system has
the required suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness. The aim of the management
review is generally to answer the following questions:

- Suitability – does the innovation management system still fit its purpose?
- Adequacy – is the innovation management system still aligned to its ambition?
- Effectiveness – does the innovation management system still achieve the
    intended results?

When conducting management reviews, the organization should consider the
following general inputs:

- the status of actions from previous management reviews;
- changes in external and internal issues that are relevant to the innovation
    management system;
- information on the innovation management system’s performance, including
    trends in:
▸ nonconformities and corrective actions;
▸ monitoring and measurement results;
▸ audit results; and
▸ opportunities for continual improvement.

The following issues should also be addressed regarding the specificities of inno-
vation activities, during the management review:

- ratio of projects and solutions in your developing process, in relation to
    your capacity;
- solutions parked for future potential development;
- learning outcomes;
- innovations achieved;
- whether the innovation initiatives:

```
▸ are achieving the intended results and why;
▸ are addressing the prioritized present and future needs and expectations
of the relevant interested parties;
▸ have the appropriate strategic fit with the innovation strategy
and objectives;
▸ are proportionally balanced in terms of opportunity and risk;
▸ if organizational knowledge and assets are sufficiently utilized; and
▸ if organizational learning is sufficient for the purpose of achieving the
innovation results.
```
The outputs of the management review can include:

- conclusions on the continuing suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness of the
    innovation management system;
- decisions related to continual improvement opportunities;
- decisions related to any need for changes to the innovation management sys-
    tem, including resources;
- actions, if needed, when innovation objectives have not been achieved;
- opportunities to improve integration of the innovation management system
    with other organizational processes, if needed; and
- any implications for the innovation vision, policy, or strategy of the organiza-
    tion and for the scope of the innovation management system.

The frequency and the depth of the management review depends on the com-
plexity of the innovation management system and innovation ambition. In our
experience, organizations usually conduct management reviews once a year.
To ensure traceability between the different meetings and also due to the sensi-
tivity of some issues treated during these meetings, it is recommended to keep
notes, record actions, or any other documented information, including the most
relevant information and decisions taken during the meeting.

### Improving the innovation management system

_Do you consider that your organization determines, selects, and implements
the necessary actions to improve the suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness
of the innovation management system?_

Today it is widely understood that any management system, no matter which
organizational aspect it is addressing, must improve over time and an innovation
management system is not exempt.
The innovation management system should improve continuously in order to
keep on developing the innovation capabilities of the organization. Depending on
your organization’s context and the results of the previous management reviews
and audits, you may decide to address its weaknesses or to reinforce its strengths.
As indicated in ISO 56002:2019, when the organization detects a gap or a deviation,
it should establish corrective actions in order to eliminate the causes of the devia-
tions found or establish improvement actions in order to close the detected gap.
However, all sources of management reviews can also be sources of improvement,
and, in our experience, the following are the most common sources of improve-
ment in organization:

- the outputs from management reviews and audits;
- feedback from customers or other interested parties;
- results of a benchmarking activity;
- results from a maturity assessment;
- results of a risk analysis;
- changes to the context of the organization;
- lessons learned from projects; and
- technological changes.

A roadmap with measures should be defined to eliminate the identified weak-
nesses, as well as to enhance the identified strengths of the innovation man-
agement system. The implementation of the improvement measures should
be monitored regarding the defined timeline, the completeness of the defined

```

tasks, and the impact expected from the measures on the innovation manage-
ment system.
It doesn’t matter if the improvement is just a small one or a huge and impressive
breakthrough; what it is important is that the organization develops a culture of
improvement and participation in improvement projects as part of the day-to-day
routine. To stimulate learning and continuous improvement within the organiza-
tion, the improvement measures and successes should be communicated within
the organization and as appropriate to external interested parties.

### Colombia

L’Instituto Colombiano de Normas Técnicas y Certificación (ICONTEC) first started
to look at research, development and innovation (RD&I) standards in 2007. One
of the first tasks was to survey published standards from other countries and to
set up a reference library for the work.
In December 2008, ICONTEC published the following standards:
▸ NTC 5800, _RD&I Management: terminology and definitions of RD&I activities_ ;
▸ NTC 5801, _RD&I Management: management systems requirements_ ;
▸ NTC 5802, _RD&I Management: requirements for RD&I projects_.

Other standards have been published since then, including:
▸ GTC 186, _RD&I Management: technological watch system_ ;
▸ GTC  1 8 7, _RD&I Management: competence and evaluation of RD&I
management system auditors_ ;
▸ GTC 248, _Innovation management. Guidance for product design
and development_.

ICONTEC has recently updated the NTC 5801 and NTC 5800 standards to incor-
porate the ISO harmonized structure and also the new guidelines published in
CEN/TS 16555-1. It has to be mentioned that these reviews are focused only on
innovation management without addressing specific needs for R&D projects
beyond those common to R&D and innovation activities.
The standardization work is carried out by national innovation experts and is
based mainly on the UNE 166000 series, BS 7000-1, Oslo Manual and the design
thinking approach.

### France

AFNOR started working on innovation topics in 2000 and launched, in 2009, the
CN INNOV to gather all stakeholders interested in developing a complete family
of standards on innovation management.
The first standards were published in 2000. In this family of standards, all the
elements of the process are taken into account, from the identification of technolo-
gies or sectors to the design and evaluation of your ability to manage innovation,
through the management and the protection of intangible assets:
▸ NF X 50-553 July 2014, _Management of research activities_ (French);
▸ FD X 50-052 May 2011, _Innovation management — Strategic intelligence
management_ (French);
▸ FD X 50-190 September 2000, _Management tools — Capitalization of
experience_ (French);
▸ FD X 50-271 December 2013, _Innovation management — Guide to
implementing an innovation management approach_ (French);
▸ FD X 50-272 January 2014, _Innovation management — Guide to implementing
an open innovation approach_ (French);
▸ FD X 50-146 December 2010, _Innovation management — Intellectual
property management_ ;
▸ NF EN 16271:2012, _Value management — Functional expression of the need
and functional performance specification — Requirements for expressing and
validating the need to be satisfied within the process of purchasing or obtaining
a product_ (formerly X 50-151),;
▸ NF EN 12973:2020, _Value management_ (formerly X 50-154);
▸ C WA 15899:2008, _Standardization of an innovation capability rating for SMEs_.

### Ireland

In 2007, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) first started to look
at standards related to innovation. Through the investigation of the roles and
benefits of standardization for organizations as well as a possible role in research,
NSAI began to focus on standards for innovation management. Standards and
knowledge of standards could be used by researchers to gain insights on what is
coming down the track in their relevant sectors. Existing standards can also be
used to demonstrate safety and compatibility of a new or yet unproven technology
in a particular sector. Standards in general reflect the “state-of-the-art”. It was
through discussions with experts in the field of innovation that the development
of a standard for managing innovation came about.
The first standard on innovation management, _SWiFT 1, Guide to good practice
in innovation and product development processes_ , was published in 2009. This
guidance document sets out a process for innovation. It was intended to raise the
baseline of innovation activities in organizations and to describe the minimum
to achieve successful innovations. The standard was developed with input from
innovation experts and is mainly based on a design thinking approach.
Since then, no additional new Irish national standards have been published.
When CEN published the seven-part CEN/TS 16555 series, Ireland adopted them
as national publications.
NSAI is actively involved in CEN/TC 389, _Innovation Management_ , and more
recently has become established within ISO/TC 2 79. NSAI is also working with
state agencies that promote competitiveness and innovation activities to encourage
the use of the CEN/TS 16555 series.

### Portugal

The Portuguese Technical Committee (TC) CT 169, Research, development and
innovation activities, initiated its work in June 2006.
The first standards were published in January 2007:
▸ NP  4 4 5 6 : 2 0 0 7, _Management of research, development and innovation (RDI) —
Terminology and definitions of RDI activities_ (January 2007) (Portuguese);
▸ NP  4 4 5 7: 2 0 0 7, _Management of research, development and innovation (RDI) —
Management System requirements of RDI_ (January 2007) (Portuguese);
▸ NP 4458:2007, _Management of research, development and innovation (RDI) —
Requirements of a RDI Project_ (January 2007) (Portuguese);
▸ NP 4461:2007, _Management of research, development and innovation (RDI)
— Competence and evaluation of RDI management system auditors and RDI
project auditors_.

Since then, English versions of NP 4456 and NP 4457 were published in 2008, being
the first two Portuguese standards to be published in English. TC/CT 169 decided,
in 2007, to develop a guidance on good practices for innovation management. To
do so, the first 24 certified companies on innovation management shared their best
practices and showed results from their management systems. This guidance was
then published by COTEC Portugal, which is a business association that promotes
business innovation and technological cooperation.
Currently, the national standards body, Instituto Português da Qualidade (IPQ),
is actively following and participating at CEN and ISO committees on innovation
management, supporting the development of International Standards.
Following the publication of the standards, the national accreditation body set
out the rules for the accreditation of certification bodies providing certification for
innovation management systems. Specific training for auditors and innovation
managers was developed and provided by COTEC in a pilot programme, which
led to those within it achieving certification for innovation management systems.

These standards are cited by the Agência Nacional de Innovação, (Innovation
National Agency) for developing financial assistance for companies asking for
funding for innovation and R&D initiatives.
Presently, there are five accredited certification bodies providing certification of
management systems and 179 active certificates on RDI management systems,
from large companies to SMEs and start-ups in several sectors.

### Spain

The development of standards for R&D and innovation management (the
UNE 166000 series), began in 1999 with the creation of the Technical Committee
(TC) CTN 166 by UNE, the Spanish standardization body. The first set of standards
was published in 2002, with several further updates and new publications. Some
of them served to support government promotion policies, such as one on the
requirements for managing RDI projects, accepted for tax-deduction purposes,
or those for consideration as ‘Innovative SME’ or ‘Innovative Young Company’,
for labelling purposes.
The main published national standards are (as of December 2021):
▸ UNE 166000:2006, _R+D+i: Terminology and definitions for R+D+i activities_ ;
▸ UNE 166001:2006, _R+D+i management: Requirements for R+D+i projects_ ;
▸ UNE 166002:2021, _R+D+i management: R+D+i management
system requirements_ ;
▸ UNE 166006:2018, _R+D+i management: Monitoring and intelligence system_ ;
▸ UNE 166008:2012, _R+D+i management: Technology transfer_ ;
▸ UNE Specification 0043:2015, _Requirements for a Young Innovative Company_ ;
▸ UNE Specification 0047:2015, _Requirements of an innovative SME._

These tools provide a systematic approach for research and innovation activities
developed in the organizations, and at the same time, gain greater control over
the process of creating new knowledge, products, services or processes.
At the end of 2020, more than 400 companies were certified to UNE 166002, giv-
ing proof of the benefits of managing and controlling these processes using best
practices on the subject.
UNE also holds the secretariat of CEN/TC 389, the European standardization com-
mittee on innovation management, liaising with ISO/TC 2 79.

### UK

The British Standards Institution (BSI) started to develop standards in the field of
innovation during the mid-1990s. In 1999, the standard BS 7000-1:1999, _Design
management systems. Guide to managing innovation_ , was published. This standard
was later revised in 2008.
Like other European countries, the UK adopted the CEN/TS 16555 series.
BSI is presently participating in the ISO/TC 279 work on innovation management.
In terms of developing standards there is nothing happening separately.

### CEN – Regional work addressing innovation management

One of the main objectives of CEN is to encourage the development of standards to
support a culture of innovation in Europe. In that context, CEN established, in the
beginning of 2008, a working group to conduct a feasibility study for European
standards on innovation management. From that study CEN/TC 389 was created in
November 2008, with the task of developing innovation management standards.
Among different goals, the committee was focused on clarifying key aspects
of innovation activities, allowing for better planning of innovation processes,
developing guidelines to train people in innovation management, and support-
ing innovation policies at a national as well as a European level. The CEN series
of technical specifications provide guidance to support leadership commitment,
assess and improve the effectiveness of the innovation management system, and
enhance the use of innovation management tools and methods.
The purpose of the CEN initiative was to develop guidelines, not requirements, for
a systematic approach to innovation management for all kinds of organizations,
regardless of their size and activity, but mainly focused on SMEs. By providing
useful tools, they would promote the benefits of this approach and support organi-
zations to develop their own procedures, saving time and reusing knowledge.
Different national and International Standards, as well as guidelines and research
publications, were taken into account at the committee level to develop the innova-
tion management technical specifications: the UNE 166000 series on RDI Manage-
ment (Spain), the NP series on RDI Management (Portugal), the BSI 7000 series
(United Kingdom), the AFNOR FD X 50 series (France) and the IMP³rove Project
(European level), among others.
In July 2013, CEN/TS 16555-1:2013, _Innovation management — Part 1: Innovation
management system_ , was published, being the first European guidance document
on this subject. After that, several other parts were published:
▸ CEN/TS 16555-2:2014, _Innovation management — Part 2: Strategic intelligence
management_ ;

In March 2020, CEN/TC 389 decided that, when available, each CEN/TS will be
replaced by the corresponding International Standard.

### ISO – An international development

The success of the CEN experience and the increasing worldwide importance of
innovation management within organizations set the ground for developing an
International Standard on an innovation management system. In December 2013,
ISO/TC 279, had its first meeting in Paris, France, organized by AFNOR.
ISO/TC 279 has a mission to develop and publish International Standards to sup-
port any kind of organization, mainly SMEs, to manage innovation activities in a
systemic and systematic way, and by using the widespread and successful model
of the ISO harmonized structure.
So far, ISO/TC 279 has developed the innovation management family of stand-
ards, including:
▸ ISO 56000:2020, _Innovation management — Fundamentals and vocabulary_ ;
▸ ISO 56002:2019, _Innovation management — Innovation management system
— Guidance_ ;
▸ ISO 56003:2019, _Innovation management — Tools and methods for innovation
partnership — Guidance_ ;
▸ ISO/TR 56004:2019, _Innovation management assessment — Guidance_ ;
▸ ISO 56005:2020, _Innovation management — Tools and methods for intellectual
property management — Guidance_.

Other standards are currently under development and should be published
by ISO/TC 279 in the coming years. Contact your national standards body for
more information.
